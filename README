for gnu/linux and other somewhat posix-compliant systems.
also works on windows somewhat.

how to compile on POSIX:
	first, install libcurl using your package manager.
		it must include the development files.
		on debian, the package name may be libcurl4-gnutls-dev.
		on arch it's just libcurl
	next, use these commands:
		git clone https://gitlab.com/squishydreams/pandaforever
		cd pandaforever
		make
		(optional) sudo make install
how to compile on windows:
	i don't know.
	i compile it *for* windows on arch linux using mingw.
		specifically, i use the mingw-w64-gcc and mingw-w64-curl packages.
		and the makefile.windows file will set CC for you.

most basic usage:
	./pandaforever --username "<username>" --password "<password>" https://exhentai.org/g/800215/61f0effbea/

for more information, there is a short man page.
read it with "man ./pandaforever.1"

zip using an external program if you so desire.
sort directories using an external program.
please back up your files or at least have some way to detect corruption.

------
By default, this program only works with exhentai.
	All links must be to exhentai.org.
	To make it work with e-hentai links only, add "-DDISABLESECRETCLUB" to the end of "CFLAGS" in "makefile" and recompile.
	It will show a warning if it worked.
	Login is not necessary for e-hentai, but original images can't be downloaded.
	Do not use this mode. it is only provided for those who want to test the program before giving it their credentials.
